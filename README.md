# Il-Guastafeste
Il guastafeste repository 

Il Guastafeste is a Party/Sound Silencer System that interacts directly with your home’s audio stereo devices and lights. 
The system is able to detect the noise present in the house, if the sound is too noisy after 23 O’Clock, 
Il Guastafeste gives the user two chances to turn down the music volume and save the relationship with the neighbours. 
If not, il Guastafeste will shut down the music and dim down the lights, breaking the party.

Il Guastafeste will be exhibited at Maker Faire Home 2016 in Rome and will be a permanent home smart living object at 
Casa Jasmina in Turin.
